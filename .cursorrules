## Project Overview
Pipeline Neo is a modern, fully modular Swift 6 framework for Final Cut Pro FCPXML processing with SwiftTimecode integration. The codebase is 100% protocol-oriented, with all major operations defined as protocols and implemented via dependency injection for maximum flexibility, testability, and future-proofing. This project targets macOS 12+, Xcode 16+, and Swift 6.0 with full concurrency support.

### Current Status
- All 66 tests passing
- Full FCPXML version support (1.5–1.14); DTDs for validation; full parsing; typed element-type coverage for all DTD elements (FCPXMLElementType)
- Final Cut Pro frame rate support (23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60)
- Thread-safe and concurrency-compliant with comprehensive async/await support
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive modular architecture with protocol-oriented design

## Modularity & Safety
- All core operations (parsing, timecode conversion, XML manipulation, error handling) are defined as protocols (e.g., FCPXMLParsing, TimecodeConversion, XMLDocumentOperations, ErrorHandling), with both sync and async/await APIs.
- Default implementations are provided, but any component can be swapped or extended via dependency injection.
- Extension APIs that cannot take parameters use a single shared instance, `FCPXMLUtility.defaultForExtensions` (concurrency-safe). No hidden concrete types in extensions; for custom pipelines use the modular API with `using:` parameter.
- All code is Sendable or @unchecked Sendable as appropriate, and passes thread sanitizer checks. The project builds and tests with Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-strict-concurrency=complete`); CI runs a job that enforces this.
- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies (including SwiftTimecode 3.0.0) as of July 2025.
- No unsafe code patterns: no unsafe pointers, dynamic code execution, or C APIs. All concurrency is structured and type-safe.
- Async/await support is comprehensive across all protocols, implementations, services, and utilities.

## Code Style and Formatting

### Swift Conventions
- Use Swift 6.0 syntax and features
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for types and protocols
- Use descriptive, clear names for all identifiers

### Documentation
- Include comprehensive header comments for all public APIs
- Use Swift documentation comments (///) for public interfaces
- Provide usage examples in documentation
- Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Follow the established header format in existing files

### File Headers
All Swift files must include the standard header format:
```swift
// Standard file header: replace [FileName], [Your Name], [Date], [Year].
//
//  [FileName].swift
//  PipelineNeo
//
//  Created by [Your Name] on [Date].
//  Copyright © [Year] [Your Name]. All rights reserved.
//
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Concurrency Requirements
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations (all major operations now have async/await APIs)
- Implement proper Sendable compliance
- Use @unchecked Sendable for classes that cannot be made final
- Avoid capturing non-Sendable types in concurrent contexts
- Use structured concurrency with Task and TaskGroup where types are Sendable
- Note: Foundation XML types (XMLDocument, XMLElement) and SwiftTimecode types are not Sendable; async/await APIs are provided, but Task-based concurrency is avoided for these types

### Error Handling
- Use Swift's Result type for operations that can fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement proper error propagation
- Use do-catch blocks for synchronous operations
- Create specific error types for different failure scenarios

### Type Safety
- Use strongly typed enums for FCPXML elements
- Implement type-safe timecode operations
- Use optionals appropriately
- Avoid force unwrapping unless absolutely necessary

## Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- SwiftTimecode: 3.0.0+ for timecode operations
- SwiftExtensions: 2.0.0+ ([orchetect/swift-extensions](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-extensions)) for String, Collection, Optional, XML helpers where useful
- Foundation: Core XML and data handling
- CoreMedia: CMTime operations and conversions

### Version Requirements
- Swift: 6.0+
- Xcode: 16.0+
- macOS: 12.0+

## File Organisation

### Source Structure
- Layout: Classes, Delegates, Errors (FCPXMLError), Extensions (including +Modular: CMTime+Modular, XMLDocument+Modular, XMLElement+Modular), Implementations, Protocols, Services, Utilities, FCPXML DTDs
- Group related functionality in extensions
- Keep files focused on single responsibilities
- Use clear file naming conventions
- Organise imports logically
- Maintain the existing directory structure

### Test Structure
- One test file per main component
- Descriptive test method names
- Comprehensive test data
- Proper setup and teardown
- Test all supported frame rates (Final Cut Pro compatible)

## Development Patterns

### Async Operations
```swift
// Standard async pattern for time conversions (implementation returns Timecode or nil).
public func timecode(from time: CMTime, frameRate: TimecodeFrameRate) async -> Timecode? {
    // Implementation
}

// Task-based concurrent operations: only when element types are Sendable.
await withTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
    for element in elements {
        group.addTask {
            // Process element
        }
    }
}
```

### Error Handling
```swift
// Result-based error handling for sync APIs.
public func parseFCPXML(from url: URL) -> Result<XMLDocument, FCPXMLError> {
    // Implementation with proper error types
}

// Async error handling: propagate FCPXMLError from underlying errors.
do {
    let document = try await loadFCPXML(from: url)
    return document
} catch {
    throw FCPXMLError.parsingFailed(error)
}
```

### SwiftTimecode Integration
- Use SwiftTimecode for all timecode operations
- Follow SwiftTimecode API conventions
- Support all FCPXML frame rates (Final Cut Pro compatible)
- Implement proper frame rate conversions
- Use the new API: `Timecode(.realTime(seconds: seconds), at: frameRate)` instead of the old `Timecode(realTime:seconds, at: frameRate)`
- Use updated frame rate enum cases: `.fps24`, `.fps25`, `.fps29_97`, `.fps30`, `.fps50`, `.fps59_94`, `.fps60`, `.fps23_976` instead of `._24`, `._25`, etc.

## Testing Requirements
