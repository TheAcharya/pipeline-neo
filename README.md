A modern Swift 6 framework for working with Final Cut Pro's FCPXML with full concurrency support and SwiftTimecode integration. Pipeline Neo is a spiritual successor to the original [Pipeline](https://github.com/reuelk/pipeline), modernised for Swift 6.0 and contemporary development practices. 

Pipeline Neo provides a comprehensive API for parsing, creating, and manipulating FCPXML files with advanced timecode operations, async/await patterns, and robust error handling. Built with Swift 6.0 and targeting macOS 12+, it offers type-safe operations, comprehensive test coverage, and seamless integration with SwiftTimecode for professional video editing workflows.

Pipeline Neo is currently in an experimental stage and does not yet cover the full range of FCPXML attributes and parameters. It focuses on core functionality while providing a foundation for future expansion and feature completeness.

This codebase is developed using AI agents.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pipeline Neo has yet to be extensively tested in production environments, real-world workflows, or application integration. This library serves as a modernised foundation for AI-assisted development and experimentation with FCPXML processing capabilities.

## Core Features

- **FCPXML I/O**: Read, create, modify documents (.fcpxml/.fcpxmld bundles); load via `FCPXMLFileLoader` (sync/async); create FCPXML from scratch with events, projects, resources, and clips.
- **Parsing & Validation**: Parse and validate against bundled DTDs (1.5–1.14); structural/reference and DTD schema validation; comprehensive test coverage with 628+ tests across 15+ FCPXML sample files.
- **Timecode Operations**: SwiftTimecode integration (`CMTime`, `Timecode`, FCPXML time strings); `FCPXMLTimecode` custom type (arithmetic, frame alignment, conversion); all FCP frame rates (23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60 fps).
- **Typed Models**: Resources, events, clips, projects, adjustments (Crop, Transform, Blend, Stabilization, Volume, Loudness, NoiseReduction, HumReduction, Equalization, MatchEqualization, Transform360, ColorConform, Stereo3D, VoiceIsolation), filters (VideoFilter, AudioFilter, VideoFilterMask with FilterParameter), transitions, multicam (Media.Multicam, Angle, MulticamSource, MCClip), captions/titles (Caption, Title with TextStyle/TextStyleDefinition), smart collections (SmartCollection with match-clip, match-media, match-ratings, match-text, match-usage, match-representation, match-markers, match-analysis-type), collections (CollectionFolder, KeywordCollection).
- **Timeline Operations**: Build `Timeline`; export to FCPXML/.fcpxmld; ripple insert, auto lane assignment, clip queries (lane/time range/asset ID), lane range computation; metadata (markers, chapter markers, keywords, ratings, custom metadata, timestamps); secondary storylines; `TimelineFormat` presets and computed properties.
- **Media Operations**: Extract asset/locator URLs; copy with deduplication; MIME type detection (`UTType`/`AVFoundation`); asset validation (existence, lane compatibility); silence detection; duration measurement; parallel file I/O; still image asset support.
- **Analysis & Conversion**: Cut detection (edit points, transitions, gaps); typed element filtering (`FCPXMLElementType`); version conversion (strip elements, validate, save as .fcpxml/.fcpxmld); per-version DTD validation; element stripping based on target version DTDs.
- **Animation**: KeyframeAnimation, Keyframe with interpolation, FadeIn/FadeOut; integrated with FilterParameter; auxValue support (FCPXML 1.11+).
- **Extensions**: CMTime Codable (FCPXML time string encoding/decoding); CollectionFolder and KeywordCollection for organization; Live Drawing (FCPXML 1.11+); HiddenClipMarker (FCPXML 1.13+); Format/Asset 1.13+ (heroEye, heroEyeOverride, mediaReps).
- **CLI**: `pipeline-neo` with `--check-version`, `--convert-version`, `--validate`, `--media-copy`, logging options (see CLI README).
- **Architecture**: Protocol-oriented, dependency-injected; sync/async APIs; Swift 6 concurrency-safe design; comprehensive test suite with file-based and logic tests.

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0+

## API Documentation

Complete manual, usage guide, and examples are in the [Documentation](Documentation/) folder:

- [Manual](Documentation/Manual.md) — Full user manual: loading, modular operations, time conversions, logging, error handling, async/await, task groups, extensions, validation, version conversion, and step-by-step examples.
- [CLI](Sources/PipelineNeoCLI/README.md) — Experimental command-line interface: `--check-version`, `--convert-version`, `--validate`, `--media-copy`, building and extending.

## FCPXML Version Support

Pipeline Neo supports FCPXML versions 1.5 through 1.14. All DTDs for these versions are included. You can validate a document against any version's schema (e.g. `document.validateFCPXMLAgainst(version: "1.14")`).
- Parsing: Any well-formed FCPXML document parses successfully; the full XML tree is available via Foundation's `XMLDocument`/`XMLElement` APIs.
- Typed element types: Every element from the FCPXML DTDs (1.5–1.14) is represented in `FCPXMLElementType`, so you can identify and filter by any element (e.g. `locator`, `import-options`, `live-drawing`, `filter-video`, all `adjust-*`, smart-collection match rules, etc.). Structural types like multicam vs compound `media` are inferred from the first child.
- Typed attributes and helpers: The framework also provides typed properties and helpers for a subset of elements (e.g. `fcpxDuration`, `fcpxOffset`, event/project/clip APIs). Other elements are fully accessible via `element.name`, `element.attribute(forName:)`, and the shared `getElementAttribute` / `setElementAttribute` helpers.

## Modularity & Safety

- Protocol-oriented and dependency-injected: core behaviour (parsing, timecode, document ops, error handling) is behind protocols with default implementations you can replace. Inject when creating FCPXMLService or FCPXMLUtility or when using modular extension overloads.
- Extension APIs that can't take a parameter use a single shared instance (FCPXMLUtility.defaultForExtensions) for consistency and concurrency safety; use overloads with a `using:` parameter for custom pipelines.
- Built with Swift 6 and strict concurrency; Sendable where possible, no unsafe code. Dependencies ([SwiftTimecode](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-timecode) 3.0.0, [SwiftExtensions](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-extensions) 2.0.0+) are up to date.

## Architecture Overview

- Protocols define parsing, timecode conversion, document operations, error handling, MIME type detection, asset validation, silence detection, asset duration measurement, and parallel file I/O; each has a default implementation you can swap. FCPXMLService (and FCPXMLUtility) composes these and exposes sync and async APIs. ModularUtilities provides createPipeline, processFCPXML, validateDocument, convertTimecodes, and similar helpers.
- FCPXMLFileLoader handles .fcpxml and .fcpxmld (including bundle Info.fcpxml). FCPXMLValidator and FCPXMLDTDValidator handle structural and schema validation; DTDs for 1.5–1.14 are bundled.
- Extensions on CMTime, XMLElement, and XMLDocument offer convenience APIs; use modular overloads with an explicit dependency to inject your own. Error types are explicit (FCPXMLError, FCPXMLLoadError, export and validation errors); you can inject a custom error handler.
