# Pipeline Neo — AI Agent Development Guide

Pipeline Neo is a modern, fully modular Swift 6 framework for Final Cut Pro FCPXML processing with SwiftTimecode integration. The codebase underwent a complete rewrite and refactor: it is now 100% protocol-oriented, with all major operations defined as protocols and implemented via dependency injection for maximum flexibility, testability, and future-proofing. This guide is for AI agents and contributors working on the project.

Keep this file in sync with `.cursorrules`. Both should describe the same overview, architecture, test structure, and conventions. When you update one, update the other.

## Project Overview

Pipeline Neo targets macOS 12+, Xcode 16+, and Swift 6.0 with full concurrency support. It provides FCPXML parsing, creation, and manipulation with timecode operations via SwiftTimecode. All core behaviour is behind protocols with both synchronous and async/await APIs; default implementations exist but any component can be swapped or extended via dependency injection.

**Backward compatibility:** The entire codebase must remain backward compatible with FCPXML 1.5. Optional attributes and elements introduced in later versions (e.g. 1.11, 1.13) must be omitted or ignored when reading/writing or converting to 1.5; mark such features in code comments with the minimum FCPXML version (e.g. `FCPXML 1.13+`).

Current status: all 628 tests passing; FCPXML versions 1.5–1.14 supported (DTDs included, full parsing, typed element-type coverage for all DTD elements via FCPXMLElementType); Final Cut Pro frame rates (23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60); thread-safe and concurrency-compliant with comprehensive async/await support; no known security vulnerabilities. Version conversion (FCPXMLVersionConverter) automatically strips elements not in the target version’s DTD (e.g. adjust-colorConform, adjust-stereo-3D); per-version DTD validation via FCPXMLService.validateDocumentAgainstDTD(_:version:) and validateDocumentAgainstDeclaredVersion(_:); CLI convert runs DTD validation after conversion. FCPXMLVersion.supportsBundleFormat is true for 1.10+ (.fcpxmld bundle); 1.5–1.9 support only single-file .fcpxml. FCPXML creation: create FCPXML documents from scratch with events, projects, resources, and clips via XMLDocumentManager, XMLDocument initializers, or FCPXMLService. Timeline manipulation: ripple insert (shifts subsequent clips), auto lane assignment, clip queries (by lane, time range, asset ID), lane range computation, secondary storylines. Timeline metadata: markers, chapter markers, keywords, ratings, custom metadata, timestamps (createdAt, modifiedAt). FCPXMLTimecode: custom timecode type (arithmetic, frame alignment, CMTime conversion, FCPXML string parsing). MIME type detection, asset validation, silence detection, asset duration measurement, parallel file I/O, still image asset support. TimelineFormat enhancements: presets (hd720p, dci4K, hd1080i, hd720i), computed properties (aspectRatio, isHD, isUHD, interlaced). Typed adjustment models: Crop, Transform, Blend, Stabilization, Volume, Loudness, NoiseReduction, HumReduction, Equalization, MatchEqualization, Transform360, ColorConform, Stereo3D, VoiceIsolation with full clip integration. Typed effect/filter models: VideoFilter, AudioFilter, VideoFilterMask with FilterParameter support and keyframe animation (auxValue support FCPXML 1.11+). Typed caption/title models: Caption and Title with TextStyle and TextStyleDefinition for full text formatting. SmartCollection models: SmartCollection with match-clip, match-media, match-ratings, match-text, match-usage (1.9+), match-representation (1.10+), match-markers (1.10+), match-analysis-type (1.14). Live Drawing (FCPXML 1.11+): LiveDrawing model for live-drawing story elements. HiddenClipMarker (FCPXML 1.13+): HiddenClipMarker model for hidden clip markers. Format/Asset 1.13+: Format heroEye, Asset heroEyeOverride, Asset mediaReps (multiple media-rep). Comprehensive test coverage: 628 tests across 15+ FCPXML sample files including 360 video, auditions, conform-rate, still images, multicam, secondary storylines, audio keyframes, keyword collections/folders, Photoshop integration, smart collections. Experimental CLI (pipeline-neo): single binary with embedded DTDs; --check-version, --convert-version (stripping + DTD validation), --extension-type (fcpxmld | fcpxml; default fcpxmld; 1.5–1.9 always .fcpxml), --validate, --media-copy; --log writes user-visible output for all commands to the log file; see Sources/PipelineNeoCLI/README.md.

## Codebase Rewrite and Refactor

The project was fully rewritten and refactored to achieve:

- A protocol-oriented design: parsing, timecode conversion, XML manipulation, error handling, MIME type detection, asset validation, silence detection, asset duration measurement, and parallel file I/O are defined as protocols (e.g. FCPXMLParsing, TimecodeConversion, XMLDocumentOperations, ErrorHandling, MIMETypeDetection, AssetValidation, SilenceDetection, AssetDurationMeasurement, ParallelFileIO) with sync and async/await methods.
- A single injection point for extension APIs that cannot take parameters: `FCPXMLUtility.defaultForExtensions` (concurrency-safe). No hidden concrete types in extensions; for custom pipelines use the modular API with the `using:` parameter.
- Consistent source layout: Classes, Delegates, Errors, Extensions (including +Modular), Implementations, Protocols, Services, Utilities, and FCPXML DTDs.
- A structured test suite: shared resources, file tests per sample, logic/parsing tests, timeline/export/validation tests, API and edge-case tests, and performance tests, all documented in Tests/README.md.

Foundation XML types (XMLDocument, XMLElement) and SwiftTimecode types are not Sendable. The codebase avoids Task-based concurrency for these types but provides async/await APIs that are concurrency-safe for Swift 6. If these dependencies become Sendable in the future, further parallelisation can be introduced.

---

## Architecture

- Protocols: Core operations are defined as protocols with both sync and async/await methods. Default implementations are provided; components can be swapped via dependency injection. Protocols include: FCPXMLParsing, TimecodeConversion, XMLDocumentOperations, ErrorHandling (sync-only, pure formatting), MIMETypeDetection, AssetValidation, SilenceDetection, AssetDurationMeasurement, ParallelFileIO, CutDetection, FCPXMLVersionConverting, MediaExtraction.
- Implementations: FCPXMLParser, TimecodeConverter, XMLDocumentManager, ErrorHandler, CutDetector, FCPXMLVersionConverter, MediaExtractor, MIMETypeDetector, AssetValidator, SilenceDetector, AssetDurationMeasurer, ParallelFileIOExecutor implement the protocols.
- Analysis: Cut detection (CutDetection protocol, CutDetector implementation) produces EditPoint and CutDetectionResult; classifies edit points by boundary type (hard cut, transition, gap) and source relationship (same-clip vs different-clips). FCPXMLService and FCPXMLUtility expose detectCuts(in:) and detectCuts(inSpine:) (sync and async).
- Version conversion: FCPXMLVersionConverting protocol and FCPXMLVersionConverter; convertToVersion(_:targetVersion:) sets root version, strips elements not in the target version’s DTD (e.g. adjust-colorConform, adjust-stereo-3D), and returns a copy; saveAsFCPXML(_:to:) saves as .fcpxml; saveAsBundle(_:to:bundleName:) saves as .fcpxmld (FCPXMLBundleExporter.saveDocumentAsBundle; only for document version 1.10 or higher; FCPXMLVersion.supportsBundleFormat is true for 1.10+). DTD validation: FCPXMLService.validateDocumentAgainstDTD(_:version:) and validateDocumentAgainstDeclaredVersion(_:); FCPXMLDTDValidator injectable; CLI convert runs validation after conversion and fails if invalid. CLI --extension-type (fcpxmld | fcpxml; default fcpxmld) controls convert output format; 1.5–1.9 always output .fcpxml. Async methods are concurrency-safe; Task-based concurrency is avoided for non-Sendable types. FCPXMLParser delegates URL loading to FCPXMLFileLoader for unified file/bundle handling and consistent parse options. TimecodeConverter guards against invalid/non-finite CMTime inputs.
- Media extraction: MediaExtraction protocol and MediaExtractor; extractMediaReferences(from:baseURL:) returns MediaExtractionResult (references from asset media-rep and locator resources; fileReferences for file URLs); copyReferencedMedia(from:to:baseURL:) copies file references to a directory with deduplication and unique filenames, returning MediaCopyResult (copied, skipped, failed). FCPXMLService and FCPXMLUtility expose both (sync and async).
- Extensions: Modular extensions for CMTime, XMLElement, and XMLDocument support dependency-injected operations and async/await. Extension APIs that cannot take parameters use FCPXMLUtility.defaultForExtensions (e.g. CMTime.fcpxmlString delegates to FCPXMLUtility.defaultForExtensions.fcpxmlTime(fromCMTime:)).
- Service: FCPXMLService orchestrates modular components for high-level workflows (sync and async). FCPXMLUtility is the legacy/convenience facade; FCPXMLService is the modern DI facade. Both delegate timecode operations to TimecodeConverter.
- Utilities: ModularUtilities provides pipeline creation (createPipeline, createCustomPipeline), validation (validateDocument delegates to FCPXMLValidator for semantic checks; the `parser:` parameter is deprecated), and helpers (processFCPXML, processMultipleFCPXML — the `errorHandler:` parameter is deprecated — and convertTimecodes using TimecodeConversion and FCPXMLTimeStringConversion protocols). For per-version DTD validation use FCPXMLService.validateDocumentAgainstDTD(_:version:) or validateDocumentAgainstDeclaredVersion(_:).
- Logging: PipelineLogger protocol with levels trace, debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical (PipelineLogLevel); NoOpPipelineLogger, PrintPipelineLogger, FilePipelineLogger (file + optional console, quiet). FCPXMLUtility and FCPXMLService use injected logger for parse, conversion, validation, save, and media operations. CLI: --log, --log-level, --quiet; when --log is set, all CLI commands (check-version, convert-version, validate, media-copy) write their user-visible messages to the log file. Extension types use #if canImport(Logging) as fallback where DI is not available.
- Versioning: FCPXMLVersion (DTD validation, 1.5-1.14) and FinalCutPro.FCPXML.Version (parsing, 1.0-1.14) are bridged via .fcpxmlVersion, .dtdVersion, and init(from:) converters. init(from:) uses safe fallback to `.latest` instead of force unwrap.
- Errors: Module-scoped error types (FCPXMLError for parsing, FCPXMLLoadError for file I/O, FCPXMLExportError/FCPXMLBundleExportError for export, FinalCutPro.FCPXML.ParseError with LocalizedError). Parse failures from FCPXMLFileLoader surface as FCPXMLError.parsingFailed so consumers handle a single parse-error type. FCPXMLElementError uses String element names for Sendable compliance.

---

## Modularity and Safety

- All major functionality is protocol-based and dependency-injected, with both sync and async/await APIs.
- Code is Sendable where appropriate; `@unchecked Sendable` removed from delegates (AttributeParserDelegate, FCPXMLParserDelegate) since they are internal-only and used synchronously. The project builds and tests with Swift 6 strict concurrency (`-strict-concurrency=complete`). CI runs a job that enforces this.
- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies (including SwiftTimecode 3.0.0) as of July 2025. No unsafe pointers, dynamic code execution, or C APIs; concurrency is structured and type-safe.

---

## Development Guidelines

Use Swift 6.0 syntax and features. Use async/await for asynchronous operations; all major operations have async/await APIs. Use structured concurrency (Task, TaskGroup) only where types are Sendable; for Foundation XML and SwiftTimecode types, provide async APIs without Task-based concurrency. Use @unchecked Sendable for classes that cannot be made final; avoid capturing non-Sendable types in concurrent contexts.

Error handling: use Swift Result for operations that can fail; provide meaningful errors; use do-catch for sync and propagate FCPXMLError in async. Use strongly typed enums for FCPXML elements (FCPXMLElementType) and type-safe timecode operations; avoid force unwrapping.

---

## Code Style and Formatting

Follow Swift API Design Guidelines. Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for types and protocols, descriptive names for all identifiers. Include comprehensive /// doc comments for all public APIs; document parameters, return values, and exceptions; provide usage examples. Group related functionality in extensions; keep files focused on single responsibilities; use clear file names and logical imports.

### File Header

All new Swift files must use this exact header format:

```
//
//  FileName.swift
//  Pipeline Neo • https://github.com/TheAcharya/pipeline-neo
//  © 2026 • Licensed under MIT License
//

//
//	Brief description of the file's purpose.
//
```

Rules:
- Replace `FileName.swift` with the actual file name.
- Replace the purpose line with a concise description of what the file contains.
- The purpose block uses a tab character after `//`, not spaces.
- Two blank lines separate the header block from the purpose block.
- Do not add `//  PipelineNeo`, `Created by`, or `Copyright ©` lines.

## Test Structure

Tests live under Tests/. The suite is organised as follows.

- Tests/README.md: Full description of test categories, how to run tests (Swift PM, Xcode, Linux), sample files, frame rates, FCPXML versions, and contributing. Keep it current when adding or changing tests.

- Tests/FCPXML Samples/FCPXML/: Sample .fcpxml files (e.g. 24.fcpxml, Structure.fcpxml, frame-rate samples). File tests and logic tests load these via shared utilities; tests that require a missing sample use XCTSkip.

- Tests/PipelineNeoTests/: Test code.
  - TestResources.swift: Path resolution (packageRoot, fcpxmlSamplesDirectory, urlForFCPXMLSample, FCPXMLSampleName) so samples work from Xcode and `swift test`.
  - FCPXMLTestUtilities.swift: loadFCPXMLSampleData(named:), loadFCPXMLSample(named:), fcpxmlFrameRateSampleNames, allFCPXMLSampleNames(); throws XCTSkip when a sample is missing.
  - CutDetectionTests.swift: Cut detection (same-clip vs different-clips, boundary types, Example FCPXML Cut 1/Cut 2, 24.fcpxml, empty spine, async, CutSample file test).
  - VersionConversionTests.swift: Version conversion (convert to target version, element stripping for 1.10/1.12, save as .fcpxml, save as .fcpxmld with 1.10+ check, bundle error when < 1.10, async).
  - TimelineManipulationTests.swift: Timeline manipulation (ripple insert, auto lane assignment, clip queries, lane range, timestamps, metadata).
  - FCPXMLTimecodeTests.swift: FCPXMLTimecode (initialization, arithmetic, comparison, CMTime conversion, frame alignment, hashing, codable).
  - MIMETypeDetectionTests.swift: MIME type detection (sync and async detection for various file types).
  - AssetValidationTests.swift: Asset validation (asset existence, lane compatibility, TimelineClip integration).
  - SilenceDetectionTests.swift: Silence detection (silence detection at start/end of audio files).
  - AssetDurationMeasurementTests.swift: Asset duration measurement (duration measurement for audio/video/images).
  - ParallelFileIOTests.swift: Parallel file I/O (concurrent read/write operations).
  - AudioEnhancementTests.swift: Audio enhancement models (NoiseReduction, HumReduction, Equalization, MatchEqualization, Clip integration).
  - Transform360Tests.swift: Transform360 adjustment (coordinate types, spherical/cartesian, clip integration).
  - CaptionTitleTests.swift: Caption and Title models (TextStyle, TextStyleDefinition, Caption/Title integration).
  - KeyframeAnimationTests.swift: Keyframe animation (FadeIn, FadeOut, Keyframe, KeyframeAnimation, FilterParameter integration).
  - CMTimeCodableTests.swift: CMTime Codable extension (encoding/decoding FCPXML time strings).
  - CollectionTests.swift: Collection organization (CollectionFolder, KeywordCollection, nested structures).
  - PipelineNeoTests.swift: Main test class; setUpWithError injects parser, timecodeConverter, documentManager, errorHandler, FCPXMLUtility, FCPXMLService. MARK sections group tests (FCPXMLUtility, FCPXMLService, modular components, async/concurrency, performance, frame rates, time values, FCPXML time strings, time conforming, error handling, document management, element filtering, modular extensions, edge cases, FCPXMLElementType, FCPXMLError, ModularUtilities API, XMLDocument extension, XMLElement extension, parser filter).
  - FileTests/: One test class per sample or category (e.g. FCPXMLFileTest_24, FCPXMLFileTest_AllSamples, FCPXMLFileTest_FrameRates, FCPXMLFileTest_360Video, FCPXMLFileTest_AuditionSample, FCPXMLFileTest_ImageSample, FCPXMLFileTest_Multicam, FCPXMLFileTest_Photoshop, FCPXMLFileTest_SmartCollection). Each loads one or more samples and asserts parse success, root, version, events, projects, or resources as appropriate.
  - LogicAndParsing/: FCPXMLRootVersionTests (Version init, rawValue, Equatable, Comparable, invalid strings), FCPXMLStructureTests (Structure sample, allEvents/allProjects, root structure), FCPXMLFormatAssetTests (Format heroEye, Asset heroEyeOverride, Asset mediaReps).
  - TimelineExportValidationTests: Timeline and TimelineClip, FCPXMLExporter, FCPXMLBundleExporter, FCPXMLValidator, FCPXMLDTDValidator, FCPXMLService.validateDocumentAgainstDTD/validateDocumentAgainstDeclaredVersion (per-version), FCPXMLFileLoader.
  - APIAndEdgeCaseTests: FCPXMLFileLoader async load(from:), PipelineLogger injection (NoOp, Print), edge cases (empty/invalid/malformed XML, invalid paths), validation types, Live Drawing (1.11+), HiddenClipMarker (1.13+).
  - FCPXMLPerformanceTests: Parameterised and basic performance tests (timecode conversion, document creation, element filtering).

Test organisation: use descriptive test method names; group related tests logically; include setup and teardown; use meaningful assertions. Test all supported frame rates (Final Cut Pro compatible). Use realistic FCPXML samples and edge cases; validate against actual FCP behaviour where applicable. Current total: 628 comprehensive tests covering all functionality including async/await, timeline manipulation, metadata, timestamps, FCPXMLTimecode, MIME type detection, asset validation, silence detection, asset duration measurement, parallel file I/O, cut detection, version conversion stripping, per-version DTD validation, extract-then-copy (CLI --media-copy flow), synchronized clip matching, secondary storyline traversal, clip identification, URL resolution, version conversion edge cases, typed adjustment models (including Transform360, ColorConform, Stereo3D, VoiceIsolation), typed effect/filter models, typed caption/title models, smart collections (match-clip, match-media, match-ratings, match-text, match-usage, match-representation, match-markers, match-analysis-type), keyframe animation, CMTime Codable extension, collection organization, Live Drawing (1.11+), HiddenClipMarker (1.13+), Format/Asset 1.13+ (heroEye, heroEyeOverride, mediaReps), 360 video features, auditions, conform-rate, still images, multicam, secondary storylines, audio keyframes, keyword collections/folders, and Photoshop integration.

## Dependencies

- SwiftTimecode 3.0.0+ for timecode operations.
- SwiftExtensions 2.0.0+ (orchetect/swift-extensions) for String, Collection, Optional, XML helpers where useful.
- Foundation for XML and data; CoreMedia for CMTime.

Swift 6.0+, Xcode 16.0+, macOS 12.0+.

SwiftTimecode usage: use `Timecode(.realTime(seconds: seconds), at: frameRate)` (not the old realTime: at: initialiser). Use frame rate cases `.fps23_976`, `.fps24`, `.fps25`, `.fps29_97`, `.fps30`, `.fps50`, `.fps59_94`, `.fps60` (not the old ._24, ._25, etc.).

---

## Common Patterns

Async operations: async methods return Timecode? or throw as appropriate; Task-based concurrency only when element types are Sendable. Example:

```swift
public func timecode(from time: CMTime, frameRate: TimecodeFrameRate) async -> Timecode? {
    // Implementation
}
```

Error handling: sync APIs use Result<_, FCPXMLError>; async APIs throw and propagate FCPXMLError (e.g. parsingFailed(Error)). FCPXMLError cases: invalidFormat, parsingFailed(Error), unsupportedVersion, validationFailed(String), timecodeConversionFailed(String), documentOperationFailed(String). See Errors/FCPXMLError.swift.

---

## Error Handling

Use Swift Result for sync; do-catch and throw for async. Provide meaningful messages and context. Implement graceful degradation where possible; proper cleanup on error. FCPXMLError is Sendable; use it for all public failure cases.

---

## Performance

Use value types where appropriate; avoid retain cycles; use weak references for delegates. Use appropriate concurrency levels and task cancellation; avoid blocking the main thread. For XML: stream when possible, use efficient parsing, cache frequently accessed data.

---

## Documentation

Public APIs: comprehensive header comments, ///, parameters/return values/exceptions, usage examples. README: project overview, installation, usage, API/modularity notes. Inline comments: explain non-obvious logic and reference external specs. Update README and Tests/README.md when adding features or changing test layout.

---

When updating either file, apply the same information to both and keep terminology and examples consistent.
